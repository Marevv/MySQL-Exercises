# MySQL-Exercises

All exercises comes from website https://www.w3resource.com/mysql-exercises/ and all credit is thier in creating it.
I just solve them for practice and show my skills. If you have any question please feel free to contact me.

Exercises were done on HR and Northwind databases that are attached to this repository in "Database" folder.
I was using MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE.
